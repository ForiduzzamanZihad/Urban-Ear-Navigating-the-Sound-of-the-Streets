 Employing transfer learning on UrbanSound8K, I built a potent audio classifier using YAMNet for embeddings. Achieved remarkable results, notably a high Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). This model has transformative potential in diverse audio applications. Join me on this journey and stay tuned for more in audio analysis!
